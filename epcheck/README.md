# EpsteinLens — OSINT Fact-Checking Backend

EpsteinLens is a backend system that ingests unstructured legal documents (depositions, emails) and structured flight logs, extracting named entities via NLP to build a **Neo4j Knowledge Graph**. The graph is then analyzed to determine the involvement level of specific individuals through a risk-classification algorithm.

## 🆕 Latest Updates (v0.1.0-alpha)

- **Frontend Dashboard** — Premium dark-themed SPA built with **Vite + React + TypeScript + Cytoscape.js**. Three views: Document Upload (drag & drop), Risk Analysis (search + risk card + evidence list), Network Explorer (force-directed graph visualization with click-to-navigate).
- **Network Depth Analysis** — New `GET /api/network/{name}` endpoint explores N-hop connections between persons via shared documents using a Cypher multi-hop query.
- **Risk Score Persistence** — `AnalysisService` now writes back the computed risk score to `Person.riskScore` in Neo4j. Also uses `NameNormalizationService` for consistent name lookup.
- **Email Chain Classification** — `classifyPageText()` now detects email chains by checking for ≥2 email header keywords (`From:`, `To:`, `Subject:`, `Cc:`, `Sent:`).
- **NER Confidence Scoring** — `NERService` now returns confidence scores from CoreNLP. Entities below threshold (default 0.60, configurable) are filtered out, reducing noise.
- **OCR for Scanned PDFs** — New `OcrService` wraps Tess4J (Tesseract OCR). When `PDFTextStripper` yields <20 chars on a page, the page is rendered at 300 DPI and passed to Tesseract. OCR'd text flows through the same NER/classification pipeline. Configured via `application.properties`.
- **Smarter Name Normalization** — New `NameNormalizationService` replaces the hardcoded 2-entry alias map with: (1) a curated alias database of 12 key individuals (~50 variations), and (2) Jaro-Winkler fuzzy matching (0.90 threshold) for typos and OCR artifacts. Zero external dependencies.
- **Snippet Sentiment Classification** — New `SentimentClassifierService` classifies the ~200-char context around each entity mention as `ACCUSATORY`, `EXCULPATORY`, or `INFORMATIONAL` using domain-specific keyword matching. Replaces the `"NEUTRAL"` placeholder on `MENTIONED_IN` relationships. Zero-dependency (no heavy CoreNLP sentiment model).
- **Flight Log Parsing** — New `FlightLogParserService` extracts dates (ISO/US formats), FAA N-number aircraft IDs, and origin/destination from flight log text via regex. Replaces all `LocalDate.now()` and `"Unknown"` placeholders in `GraphPersistenceService`.
- **Transactional Persistence + Retry** — Extracted graph writes into `GraphPersistenceService` with `@Transactional` (atomic writes — all succeed or all roll back) and Spring Boot 4.0 native `@Retryable` (3 retries with exponential backoff for transient Neo4j failures).
- **Batch Graph Persistence** — Replaced per-entity `save()` calls with batch operations: single `findAllByNormalizedNameIn()` fetch, in-memory Person map, and `saveAll()` for FlightLogs and Persons. Reduces ~3N DB round-trips to ~3 total.
- **Single-Pass PDF Extraction** — Refactored `DocumentIngestionService` to load the PDF only once. Text extraction, NER, and classification now happen in a single page-by-page pass via `PageExtractionResult` objects, with graph persistence deferred until after the PDF is closed — significantly reducing memory overhead on large files.
- **Full Graph Implementation** — `Person`, `Document`, `FlightLog` nodes and rich relationships (`MENTIONED_IN`, `FLEW_ON`) are fully modeled and operational using Spring Data Neo4j.
- **Async Ingestion Engine** — `DocumentIngestionService` uses Kotlin Coroutines (`suspend` + `Dispatchers.IO`) to handle PDF parsing and NER without blocking.
- **Risk Analysis Logic** — `AnalysisService` categorizes individuals into **RED / ORANGE / YELLOW / GREEN** risk levels based on flight logs, mention frequency, and keyword context.
- **Batch Ingestion API** — New `POST /api/ingest/batch` endpoint accepting a ZIP file containing multiple PDFs, processing them sequentially and returning a detailed `BatchIngestionReport`.
- **Temporal Analysis & Alias Auto-Discovery** — Added Timeline tracking to see when an entity appears over time, and an Alias suggestion engine detecting shared surnames and proximity names during ingestion.
- **Relationship Strength Scoring** — Edges in the knowledge graph now have a computed strength score based on co-occurrence, shared flights, and sentiment overlap, visualized in the Network Explorer.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization** — Added strict MIME type and Magic Byte checking for uploaded files, a 500-page limit per document, and text sanitization to protect the NER engine from malicious or malformed characters.
- **Global Error Handling** — Added a Spring `@ControllerAdvice` global exception handler returning a standardized `ErrorDTO` for all API errors.
- **Monitoring & Rate Limiting** — Added Spring Boot Actuator with Prometheus metrics (custom metrics for ingestion and NER), visualized via Grafana. Added an IP-based sliding-window `RateLimitFilter`.
- **Production Docker & CI/CD** — Multi-stage Dockerfile, complete GitHub Actions workflow (lint → test → build → push), and a robust `compose.yaml` with profiles (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
- **Event-Driven Ingestion (Kafka)** — Moved from blocking HTTP requests to async message-driven ingestion. Added `POST /api/ingest/async` returning a `jobId` immediately (202 Accepted), with background processing by a Kafka consumer and status polling via `GET /api/ingest/status/{jobId}`.
- **Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS)** — Integrated the GDS plugin to run advanced network algorithms. Exposed `GET /api/gds/pagerank` (to find central/influential figures) and `GET /api/gds/communities` (Louvain modularity to detect hidden syndicates).
- **REST API** — Endpoints for document upload (`POST /api/ingest`) and profile analysis (`GET /api/analyze/{name}`) are exposed.
- **Swagger UI** — Integrated OpenAPI 3 documentation, accessible at `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

## 🧬 Domain Model (Graph Schema)

We use **Rich Relationships** (relationship properties) to store context directly on the edge.

```
(:Person)-[:MENTIONED_IN {pageNumber, snippet, sentiment}]->(:Document)
(:Person)-[:FLEW_ON {flightDate, aircraftId, origin, destination}]->(:FlightLog)
```

### Nodes

| Node | Key Properties | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Person` | `name`, `normalized_name`, `risk_score` | An individual. `normalized_name` enables fuzzy matching (e.g. "Bill Clinton" → "william jefferson clinton") |
| `Document` | `fileHash` (SHA-256, PK), `filename`, `ingestionDate`, `docType` | A source PDF. `docType`: `DEPOSITION`, `FLIGHT_LOG`, or `EMAIL_CHAIN` |
| `FlightLog` | `flightDate`, `aircraftId`, `origin`, `destination` | A flight record extracted from flight log documents |

### Relationships

| Relationship | Direction | Properties | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MENTIONED_IN` | `Person → Document` | `pageNumber`, `snippet`, `sentiment` | Links a person to the document page where they appear |
| `FLEW_ON` | `Person → FlightLog` | `flightDate`, `aircraftId`, `origin`, `destination` | Links a person to a flight record |

## ⚙️ Key Components

### DocumentIngestionService (Orchestrator)

Orchestrates the ingestion pipeline. Processes uploaded PDFs in a **single pass**:

1. **SHA-256 Deduplication** — Skips files already ingested (hash used as Document PK).
2. **Single-Pass Page Iteration** — One `Loader.loadPDF()` call, iterating page by page:
   - Extracts text via `PDFTextStripper`
   - Runs NER via `NERService` → collects `PageExtractionResult` objects
   - Classifies document incrementally (checks for `N908JE`, `Cessna` keywords — short-circuits on first match)
3. **Delegates Persistence** — PDF is closed (memory freed), then calls `GraphPersistenceService.persistIngestionResults()`

### GraphPersistenceService (Persistence Layer)

Handles all Neo4j writes with reliability guarantees:

- **`@Transactional`** — All writes (Document, FlightLogs, Persons + relationships) happen atomically. If any write fails, everything rolls back.
- **`@Retryable`** — Transient Neo4j errors (connection timeouts, leader elections) trigger up to 3 retries with exponential backoff (500ms → 1s → 2s, max 5s).
- **Batch Operations** — Single `findAllByNormalizedNameIn()` fetch, in-memory Person map, and `saveAll()` calls. Reduces ~3N DB round-trips to ~3 total.

### NERService

Wraps Stanford CoreNLP with an optimized pipeline (`tokenize,ssplit,pos,lemma,ner`). Disables `parse` and `sentiment` annotators to minimize memory usage. Filters for `PERSON` entity type only.

### AnalysisService

The risk classification engine. Algorithm:

| Risk Level | Condition | Score |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **RED** | Has ≥ 1 `FLEW_ON` relationship | 100 |
| 🟠 **ORANGE** | Has > 5 mentions OR snippets contain keywords (`"massage"`, `"recruit"`) | 75 |
| 🟡 **YELLOW** | Found in graph but doesn't meet RED/ORANGE criteria | 25 |
| 🟢 **GREEN** | Not found in graph | 0 |

Returns a `RiskReportDTO` with sorted evidence items (document mentions + flight records).

## 📝 Design Decisions

- **Why Neo4j + Spring Data Neo4j?** — Graph model naturally represents person-document-flight relationships. SDN provides clean OGM mapping to Kotlin data classes with `@RelationshipProperties` for rich edges.
- **Why Stanford CoreNLP?** — Robust NER for English. Heavy (~4GB models), but optimized by disabling `parse`/`sentiment` annotators and setting `ner.applyFineGrained=false`.
- **Why Coroutines over Threads?** — PDF ingestion is I/O-intensive. Coroutines allow scaling without blocking threads, with `Dispatchers.IO` for file and DB operations.
- **Why Single-Pass?** — Avoids loading the PDF DOM twice, cutting memory in half for large files. Classification is done incrementally during the page iteration.
- **Why separate GraphPersistenceService?** — `@Transactional` and `@Retryable` work via Spring AOP proxy interception, which requires *external* method calls. Extracting persistence into a separate `@Service` ensures the AOP proxy is invoked correctly, while keeping `DocumentIngestionService` focused on extraction logic.
